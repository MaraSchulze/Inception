# :whale: Inception
Creating your own wordpress site with docker containers.  
I created 3 containers, MariaDB, Wordpress and nginx. They all have Debian:Buster as base image and then install the programs with the help of shell scripts.  
I also used docker-compose, a docker network and 2 docker volumes.  

## Details
This was a 42Heilbronn project, the description is in the pdf file.  

## Usage
```
cd real_inception
make
```
