# Inception
Creating your own wordpress site with docker containers.

This was a 42Heilbronn project, the description is in the pdf file.
There are 3 containers, nginx, MariaDB and Wordpress. They all have Debian:Buster as base image and then install the programs with the help of shell scripts.

Change into real_inception and make.
